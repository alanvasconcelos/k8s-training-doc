#### Why I created this site ?
- I want to giveback something to the kubernetes community.

- This site can be used as a pocket guide.

- I spent countless hours to learn kubernetes from ground up by referring many online resources  and it was not an easy job to get everything in one place.

- Humongous effort has been put up for making this tutorial so that your can save a lot of time.

Enjoy your Kubernetes learning adventure <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>
